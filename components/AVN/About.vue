        A.V.N monitors crops and markets, making projections on what foods to
        grow and why, optimizing inputs and targeting specialized markets. With
        a built-in e-commerce marketplace. Our platform connects farmers,
        suppliers and manufacturers based on locational intelligence and
        off-taker contracts.  
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        A.V.N’s system thinking design allows us to leverage data and smart tech
        to organize and coordinate food production at the source, while easing
        the strain on our biodiversity. A.V.N also allows us to control,
        correct, or isolate every step of production through data analytics and
        machine learning. We work along side the farmers to grow plant – based
        products and timber, reducing waste and optimizing the use of human
        labour and tech.
