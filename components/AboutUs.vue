            AVN is designed to organise and coordinate organic production. We
            empower small-holder farmers by providing an end-to-end hybrid
            solution to replace outdated conventional farming methods. Our
            approach focuses on nature-based solutions, boosting productivity,
            climate resilience, and visibility in global markets.

            Food security in a context of growing populations and a changing
            climate is arguably the principal challenge of our time. Going into
            2023, current food systems are unsustainable – both from
            environmental and social perspectives. In the African continent,
            more than 63% of 1.4 billion people are small-scale farmers
            operating in the informal sector. They are the invisible source of
            food in global supply-chains and have no financial identities or
            access to controlled farming systems.

          Agriculture is facing seismic shifts because of the ineffectiveness of
          conventional farming to address food insecurity, poverty, and the loss
          of biodiversity. The informal sector in Africa has a massive social
          and economic footprint especially on women and young people.
          Small-scale farmers face critical challenges from changing food
          systems, urbanisation, and climate change.

          The Agriculture Value Chain Network (A.V.N) creates symbiotic
          ecosystems that intertwine communities and ethical value chains
          through technology and the science of nature. We envision eco-friendly
          food supply chains that are productive, and profitable without
          degrading the land, feeding us all poison and abusing the farmers. We
          integrate circular economics, climate change mitigation and social
          innovation to create farming systems for the future.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We connect and organize farmers to grow large quantities of organic
          commodities through decentralized controlled environment agriculture
          (CEA), agroforestry and permaculture. In developing countries, we
          offer smart contracts giving our member farmers a financial identity
          through a formalization process, essentially, we make them work from
          home enabling them to earn across the supply chain
