            At Invictus Development Africa (IDA), we are a global social
            enterprise committed to building sustainable ecosystems that empower
            communities while protecting the planet. Guided by circular economy
            principles, we develop and scale transformative solutions in

          Agriculture is facing seismic shifts because of the ineffectiveness of
          conventional farming to address food insecurity, poverty, and the loss
          of biodiversity. The informal sector in AfricaÂ has a massive social
          and economic footprint especially on women and young people.
          Small-scale farmers face critical challenges from changing food
          systems, urbanisation, and climate change.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          The Agriculture Value Chain Network (A.V.N) creates symbiotic
          ecosystems that intertwine communities and ethical value chains
          through technology and the science of nature. We envision eco-friendly
          food supply chains that are productive, and profitable without
          degrading the land, feeding us all poison and abusing the farmers. We
          integrate circular economics, climate change mitigation and social
          innovation to create farming systems for the future.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We connect and organize farmers to grow large quantities of organic
          commodities through decentralized controlled environment agriculture
          (CEA), agroforestry and permaculture. In developing countries, we
          offer smart contracts giving our member farmers a financial identity
          through a formalization process, essentially, we make them work from
          home enabling them to earn across the supply chain
